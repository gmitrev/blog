My name is Georgi and I live in [Sofia,
Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia){:target="_blank"}. I have been
working as a software developer for more than 12 years and have a lot of experience in everything
related to the web.

I am a serial side-project creator. Check out what I'm currently working on in the
[projects](/projects) page.

My favourite programming language is Ruby and my second favourite one is Ruby. Yes, I like Ruby. I
can do frontend and infrastructure work almost as good as I can do backend. Also, I'm looking for a
job. Check out my
  [resume]({{"/assets/resume.pdf"}}){:target="_blank"} to find out more about my work experience.

I
[like to read books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5114198-georgi-mitrev){:target="_blank"},
[listen to heavy metal](https://www.last.fm/user/gosshedd){:target="_blank"} and
[write a lot of code while doing so](https://github.com/gmitrev){:target="_blank"}.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}. The theme was created by me, which you can
probably tell by looking at its awesome colors and cool squiggly underlines.
